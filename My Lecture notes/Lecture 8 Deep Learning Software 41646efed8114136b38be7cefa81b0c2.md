# Lecture 8 | Deep Learning Software

- to learn CUDA there is CS334 in udacity
- CPU vs GPU

    - what to do if dataset is bigger than ram?
        - use multiple threads of the CPU to read data from the SSD and buffer it in Ra<
- PyTorch is Dynamic works well for recurrent networks and TensorFlow is static and optimized.
